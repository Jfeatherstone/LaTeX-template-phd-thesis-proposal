# OIST Thesis Proposal LaTeX Template

This is an unofficial template for the OIST Thesis Proposal, based on the
version created by Jeremie Gillet. As of August 2025 and to the best of my
knowledge, this is the only up-to-date version of this template.

Be sure to read through the default PDF for instructions on how to use
this template effectively.

You will find the most recent version of the guidelines for the thesis proposal
in Section 5 of the [Graduate School Policies](https://www.oist.jp/education/policies-regulations/gs-policies).

In case these requirements change, the exact version of the formatting
requirements to which this template adheres can be found here:

Since the formatting requirements change every so often, feel free to email
me or raise an Issue on Github if this template needs to be updated in any way.

If you use LaTeX locally, you can just download the [latest release files](https://github.com/Jfeatherstone/LaTeX-template-phd-thesis-proposal/releases)

but of course this varies depending on your system. At least on Ubuntu,
a good start is always to install the following packages:
