# OIST Thesis Proposal LaTeX Template

This is an unofficial template for the OIST Thesis Proposal, based on the
version created by Jeremie Gillet. As of August 2025 and to the best of my
knowledge, this is the only up-to-date version of this template.

You will find the most recent version of the guidelines for the thesis proposal
in Section 5 of the [Graduate School Policies](https://www.oist.jp/education/policies-regulations/gs-policies).

In case these requirements change, the exact version of the formatting
requirements to which this template adheres can be found here:

Since the formatting requirements change every so often, feel free to email
me or raise an Issue on Github if this template violates the current
requirements in any way.
