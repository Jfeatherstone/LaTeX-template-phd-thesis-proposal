\chapter{How to Use the Template} \label{ch-2}

This is a practical guide into how to use this template, by explaining the role
of the different folders and files. The basic structure of this folder should
look like:
\texttt{
\\
|--- Thesis\_proposal.tex \\ 
|--- Images/ \\ 
|--- MainText/ \\ 
\hspace*{0.5cm}|--- chapter1.tex\\
\hspace*{0.5cm}|--- chapter2.tex\\
\hspace*{0.5cm}|--- chapter3.tex\\
|--- Preamble/ \\ 
\hspace*{0.5cm}|--- mydefinitions.tex\\
\hspace*{0.5cm}|--- abstract.tex\\
\hspace*{0.5cm}|--- physics\_bibstyle.bst\\
\hspace*{0.5cm}|--- Thesis\_bibliography.bib\\
}

If some practices seem like overkill for a 20 page proposal (splitting the
content across different files), that is because it probably is, but we built
it this way because the PhD thesis template is structured identically. That
means that you will be able to incorporate this document into your thesis seamlessly.

\section{The \texttt{Preamble} Folder}

You should edit the basic information about the thesis proposal
which can be found in the file \texttt{Preamble/mydefinitions.tex}. This includes
your name, the name of supervisor (and co-supervisor, if applicable) your title, 
and the date.

This file also contains the bibliography settings, custom packages, and any custom
commands that you many want to use. The default bibliography style is defined in
\texttt{Preamble/physics\_bibstyle.bst}, which was created by Jeremie Gillet in 2011
for his thesis. Feel free to swap this file out with a style more suited to your
field, and be sure to change the file name in \texttt{Preamble/mydefinitions.tex}
(line 19). By default, the bibliography file containing
your references is \texttt{Preamble/Thesis\_bibliography.bib}, so you should
replace this file with your own version. If you'd like to store your bibliography
information somewhere else (for example, if you have one master file for all of your
LaTeX projects) you can edit the appropriate section in \texttt{Thesis\_proposal.tex}
(should be around line 140).

You should write your abstract in the file \texttt{Preamble/abstract.tex}. This
should not be longer than a single page.

\section{The \texttt{MainText} Folder}

For the thesis proposal, the main text should be split across three chapters:
the introduction and literature review, the research plan, and the progress report.
Each of these chapters should be written in a standalone file located in
the \texttt{MainText} folder, for example:
\texttt{
\\
|--- MainText/ \\ 
\hspace*{0.5cm}|--- chapter1.tex\\
\hspace*{0.5cm}|--- chapter2.tex\\
\hspace*{0.5cm}|--- chapter3.tex\\
}
If you'd like to rename or add new files, make sure to change where they are
referenced in \texttt{Thesis\_proposal.tex} (around line 125). If you wanted
to add an appendix, you would create a new file in \texttt{MainText/}, though
add them to \texttt{Thesis\_proposal.tex} around line 150 instead.
Your thesis may have several other chapters here, for example, Conclusions.

\section{The \texttt{Images} Folder}

All the images that you will use in your thesis should be placed in the \texttt{Images}
folder. This can contain subfolders, for example one for each chapter. To include
an image from the main text, use something like
\texttt{\textbackslash includegraphics\{subfolder/image.jpg\}}; no need to
worry about the path to the \texttt{Images} folder.

\section{The \texttt{Thesis\_proposal.tex} File}

This is the main TeX file that takes input from all of the previously discussed
files in the \texttt{Preamble} and \texttt{MainText} folders. To generate your
document, this is the file you should compile. Compile once with \LaTeX,
once with BibTeX and finally twice more with \LaTeX\ to get all the references right.

You probably won't need to edit this file very much, but in case you are
looking for a specific setting or something, the following settings are
defined in this file:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Basic packages
    \item Loading of in custom values from \texttt{Preamble/mydefinitions.tex}
    \item Title page
    \item Headers and footers
    \item Table of Contents
    \item Thesis main text import
    \item Bibliography file (not style)
    \item Appendices
\end{itemize}
